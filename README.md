# Movie Roulette

This is a Python application that will select either a completely random movie or a random movie from a list you create while using the app.

## Installation

Download the whole project as a zip and extract the zip wherever you like. This program is also tested only with Python 3.9. We can not promise that it will work with later versions.


## Usage

When in the directory on the command line use:
```
py main.py
```
You can also just double-click the main.py file.

## The Team

We are a team of five who worked together to put out this product. We are Samuel Jackson, Will Critendon, Cristopher Hattan, Luke Jordan, and Owen Book.
Luke and Will were involved in creating the front end of the application, while Sam, Chris, and Owen were charged with the logic.
